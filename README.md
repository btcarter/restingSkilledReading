# Skilled Reading: Resting State Analysis of the Visual Word Form Area

This repository contains the analysis scripts used to examine resting state data and determine who has some connectivity with the VWFA in Skilled Readers. These scripts were originally written by Nathan Muncy in the [Kirwan Memory Lab at BYU][1]. I also used this as an opportunity to teach myself how Nate builds structural templates ([which he did for us on our last paper][3]).

## Analysis steps
1. Conducted [term based automated meta-analysis via Neurosynth][2], 2019-04-08 with an FDR of 0.01. Coordinates with the highest Z-score in the left fusiform gyrus was selected as seed.
