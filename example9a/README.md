# Notes on the "Jahn" analysis

1. This was run using the example 9 from the AFNI docs for `afni_proc.py`.
1. 7 participants (S13, S24, S27, S3, S31, S38, S6) were excluded due to motion during step 2 of the analysis. This perhaps could be rectified by relaxing motion censor parameters. I did not do this. This leaves 34 participants.
2. Seed coordinates are -42, -44, -14 from the automated meta-analysis.
